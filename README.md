# Flappy Bird Game in Python

This repository contains the Flappy Bird game built using Python's Pygame module. It is a recreation of the classic game where the player controls a bird navigating through obstacles by flapping its wings.

## Features
- **Game Loop**: Ensures smooth gameplay with continuous rendering and updates.
- **Events**: Handles user input such as key presses to control the bird.
- **Sprites**: Manages graphical elements like the bird, pipes, and background.
- **Sound**: Adds sound effects to enhance the gameplay experience.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed and the Pygame library set up:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AYMAN5029/Flappy-Bird.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
